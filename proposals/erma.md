ERMA - Next generation disaster response from NOAA

Abstract
========

ERMA(R) (Environmental Response Management Application) is an online mapping tool that integrates both static and real-time data such as Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) maps, ship locations, weather, and ocean currents in a centralized, easy-to-use format for environmental responders and decision makers. Developed by NOAA and the University of New Hampshire with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Coast Guard, and the Department of Interior, ERMA provides environmental resource managers with the data necessary to make informed decisions for environmental response.

In 2010, ERMA was chosen as the COP (Common Operational Picture) for all federal, state and local spill responders during  the Deepwater Horizon/BP oil spill. Today it remains a critical resource to restoration efforts in the Gulf of Mexico.   Leveraging open source technologies, ERMA has been customized with site-specific tools and data for eight different geographic regions and continues to show immense flexibility to adapt and scale to a diverse user base for environmental response.

As we move the ERMA project into the next generation, we are pushing the bounds of how ERMA scales, leverages new technology, and integrates into the government IT ecosystem.  This talk will provide an overview of ERMA development and why Open Source and standards-based approaches were adopted.  Learn how ERMA performed during the DWH/BP oil spill response and ongoing restoration efforts.  Gain insight on new open-source technologies, tools, collaborative development models and trends that are driving the future of disaster response.
