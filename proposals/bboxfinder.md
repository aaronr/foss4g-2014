bboxfinder.com - Building the Cascadia Open Source GIS Community one little tool at a time...

Abstract
========

Cascadia Users of Geospatial Open Source (CUGOS) is a regional chapter of OSGeo guided by the belief that getting our hands dirty building simple, but useful tools is a great way to learn.  First there was projfinder.com, a simple way for people with coordinates in an unknown projection (but with a general idea of where their data is) to find likely projections.  Following up on the success of that effort we launched the next in the series of "*finder.com" CUGOS projects, bboxfinder.com.

Built on a simple stack of open source tools, bboxfinder.com aims to be a resource for finding all things related to bounding box coordinates.  The website allows users to draw or import shapes from geojson to capture a bounding box for the data.  It supports on-the-fly reprojection of coordinates into all EPSG coordinates systems and tile bounds can be visualized as well as identified.

This project, just like projfinder.com before it, has proven to be an valuable teaching and learning tool within CUGOS.  Multiple "hack sessions" dedicated to getting active contributors have attracted new developers to participate in the CUGOS community.  Finally, this project -- like many things CUGOS does, is hosted on Git Pages making it an accessible and fun project to participate in.

Come learn about the tool, the development process, and how development of these simple tools is building community in Cascadia!
