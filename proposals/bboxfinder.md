bboxfinder.com - Building the Open Source Community one little tool at a time...

Abstract
========

Cascadia Users of Geospatial Open Source (CUGOS) is a regional chapter of OSGeo with the belief that getting our hands dirty building simple (but useful) tools is a great way to learn.  First there was projfinder.com... a simple way for people with coordinates in an unknown projection (but a general idea of where their data is) to find likely projections.  To follow up on the success of that effort we launched the next in the series of "*finder.com" CUGOS projects: bboxfinder.com.

Built on a simple stack of Open Source tools, bboxfinder.com attempts to be a resource for finding all things related to bounding box coordinates.  The website allows users to draw shapes or import shapes from geojson to capture a bounding box for the data.  A system of on-the-fly reprojection of coordinates into all EPSG coordinate systems is also supported.  Tile bounds can be visualized as well as identified.

This project (just like projfinder.com before it) has proven to be an valuable teaching/learning tool within CUGOS with multiple "hack sessions" dedicated to getting active contributors.  Finally this project (like many things CUGOS does) is hosted on Git Pages.

Come learn about the tool, the development process, and how development of these simple tools is building community in Cascadia!
